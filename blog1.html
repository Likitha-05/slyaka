                    ones, have to acclimatize to the changing scenario by leveraging social media platforms and 
                    digital tools. Social media presence can not only increase your visibility in the market but 
                    will also streamline your overall business. SEO is also considered a treasure trove of online 
                    businesses.
                </p>

                    your website and generating more engagement with the customers. This will not only give you 
                    a powerful leg up by boosting your sales but will also improve your business in many ways.
                </p>
                <p>As per the statistics, 73% of marketers leverage SEO to grow their current businesses and 61% 
                    of them aver that SEO has improved their business significantly
                </p>
                <p>So, let's delve into the detail of what is SEO and how it can be a boon for small businesses.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>What is SEO?</h3>
                <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and it is the process of 
                    increasing organic (non-paid) visibility for any website by enabling 
                    the website to rank higher on search engine result pages (SERPs). 
                    This requires stuffing the pages of your online website with the 
                    right number of keywords through effective keyword placement techniques. 
                    This also requires you to focus on other look and feel aspects of 
                    your website mainly site speed, mobile friendliness, the responsiveness 
                    of pages, interactivity, and the relevant content of web pages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>How SEO is beneficial for small businesses?</h3>
                <p>It is imperative to understand the nuts and bolts of SEO and expend 
                    your time and effort on certain SEO-based tools. This will result 
                    in generating long-term value and will be beneficial for your small 
                    businesses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Search engine optimization strategies are proven to be 
                    beneficial for small businesses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <h5>Increased traffic through Organic Search:</h5>
                      <p>If your website can fulfill customers’ needs in any business by 
                        understanding what type of content they intend to see; it 
                        automatically results in turning the potential clients into 
                        high-paying clients. As currently, 53.3% of all web traffic 
                        comes from organic search hence it is vital to get technical 
                        know-how of how SEO works and what are your customer’s expectations. 
                        This will lead to boosting your sales.</p>
                      <p>By prioritizing the needs of the customer first, you keep 
                        them hooked onto your website for a longer duration. Be 
                        proactive to understand what other information, resources, 
                        or services you can provide to them. Doing so, the more 
                        authoritative your site will exist, this will ultimately boost 
                        the sales of your small business.</p>
                    </li>
                    <img src="imgs/seo1.jpg" alt="Seo strategies" class="img-fluid" style="width: 550px;">
                    <li>
                    <h5>Relevant Content for the websites:</h5>
                      <p>Ranking on the first page of Google search results is necessary 
                        for customers to see your webpage and make an informed decision 
                        about the purchase of your products or services. Thus, their 
                        click-through rate is dependent primarily on authentic, genuine, 
                        valuable, and attentive content about your valuable brand that 
                        meets their needs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Create a trustworthy experience with easy navigation:</h5>
                        <p>For a facile experience with your website, the technical 
                            elements of SEO such as the use of backlinks, meta description, 
                            title tags, page speed, and overall website navigation must 
                            be properly in place. </p>
                        <p>The website navigation must also be user-friendly and easy 
                            to understand. All web pages in a navigation menu must be 
                            indexed easily by search engines. Customers trust you and 
                            become repeat customers for you based on the functionality 
                            of your website. Fast responsive websites along with the 
                            addition of authority-building elements in SEO are crucial 
                            for the success of your small businesses. </p>
                        <p>Apart from this, visual media must be relevant to the page 
                            content. Visually engaging media is interesting for users as well.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Incorporating the right SEO marketing tactics, getting insights 
                    from Facebook, Instagram, and Google Analytics, and keeping your 
                    ear to the ground will help you to explore social media platforms 
                    comprehensively and intensively. Inculcating the right SEO strategies
